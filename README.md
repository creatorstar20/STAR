# STAR
The goal of star is to create a new open financial system. After users register, they don't need any real name information and reconstruct the real anonymous financial infrastructure
Anonymous registration, anonymous transaction, smart contract, distributed 0tc transaction, super master node, lucky turntable, protocol sharing network. All these functions echo, circulate and balance each other, forming a strong internal structure in the early stage of star. Its internal financial balance, community promotion, business docking, value precipitation and network expansion will subvert the concept behind the centralized business model. Through the joint efforts of the community, we will create a new and decentralized free ecology of the Internet, and gradually open the ecological functional areas of open finance such as lending, asset management, asset trading, investment and financing.



In terms of operation strategy, star takes decentralized community win-win as the guiding principle, and motivates usdt users as the main force to start the project. Following the principle of decentralization, it weakens the community influence of the development team to the greatest extent. This has created more room for the long-term development of STAR, because USDT has not skyrocketed, nor has it plummeted, nor has it blown the bigger bubbles. So USDT is definitely a very unique currency. It is reasonable for investors to convert the value in the market into usdt and transfer the usdt to their star wallet. When the opportunity to buy appears, investors can quickly convert usdt into star, and use it to do the next action, without waiting for bank wire transfer settlement like us dollars.



What star brings is not only a new cryptocurrency, but also a new blockchain product. What it brings is a completely decentralized open financial network, a truly subversive business practice, and the reshaping of the decentralized Internet. It leads mankind to the door of freedom, is an immortal idea and indestructible thought.
